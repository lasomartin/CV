        <h3>Financial Management, does it matter in our lives?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Financial Management is the activity of procuring funds, maximizing profits and minimizing expenses to meet organization objectives.</p>
        <p>According to;</p>
        <p><b>1. Solomon Ezra and Jhon Pringle:</b> “Financial Management is concerned with the efficient use
            of an important economic resource namely, capital funds”.</p>
        <p><b>2. Dr. S. N. Maheshwari:</b> “Financial management is concerned with raising financial resources
            and their effective utilization towards achieving the organizational goals”.</p>
        <p>An effective utilization of funds is important in every aspect of life. Whether you're running a business organization or a family. Because the future is so uncertain that keeping a certain amount of asset reserves or investments become handy in the event of tackling retirement, inflation, war and economic crisis.</p>
        <p>So, this is what it looks like. The outcome you are expecting and the result you see is never the same&#128555;</p>
        <p>You are getting close. Keep up the good work! &#129310;</p>

              <h2>Security tips!</h2>
              <p>As a general rule, never open unknown link, file or app from unknown sources - social media, browser, SMS or email.</p>
              <h2>Why?</h2>
              <p>It's possible to attach with a maleware and can run silently (gets activate) in the background the moment you open them. It sounds like a Witchcraft Spellbound, doesn't it? But don't worry. It's harmless if you don't do anything. You can delete them right away.</p>
              <h2>How bad is that?</h2>
              <p>Once, your <b>device is compromise</b>, they can read your SMS, whatsapp, gmail, setting, access webcam, phone camera, erase data and if you have stored valuable information, they can even read that unless encrypted. So, your anti-virus and password will not prevent them from doing anything. And you don't want that unless you don't care about your PRIVACY.</p>
